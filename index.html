                <h1>BTS: The Global Sensation</h1>
                <p> BTS (Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that began 
                    formation in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The septet—composed of RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, 
                    Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their 
                    musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social 
                    commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving 
                    oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes 
                    an alternative universe storyline. The group has released several albums and performed on several world tours.

                    <p>
                        “Effort makes you. You will regret someday if you don’t do your best now. Don’t think it’s too late but keep 
                        working on it. It takes time, but there’s nothing that gets worse due to practicing. So practice. You may get 
                        depressed, but it’s evidence that you are doing good.”
